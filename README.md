# Project 4
Project 4 is a GUI based application that reads in data from a .csv file.  Each entry of the .csv file contains a baby name, birth year, gender, and name count.

The GUI comes equipped with features that allow you to search baby names by year, and name.

There is a sorting feature that allows a user to find the top 10 baby names for a given year and gender.
